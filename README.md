# Book Library
## Project Description
This repository contains a simulation of a Book Library System. Users can search for books available in the library or purchase books from the library, provided that the library has the needed book in sufficient quantity.

Youâ€™ll find two versions of the Books Inventory in the `Additional Files` folder:

Original Inventory File: This is the initial inventory.
Validation Inventory File: This version includes additional validations.

>[!NOTE]
>I have added extra validations for when a book is found by name in the Inventory but is listed with a quantity of Zero **(Inventory Update Mistake)**
